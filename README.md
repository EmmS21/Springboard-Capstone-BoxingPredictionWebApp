# Springboard-Capstone-BoxingPredictionWebApp
 
The objective of this project is to build:
i.) a web app returning the percentage likelihood of a boxing fight ending in a particular outcome
ii.) an interactive dashboard with a custom boxer rank by division, comparisons between different fight stances and age groups based on the data extracted

As mentioned this project also includes the code relevant to my boxing prediction web app. 

Under the ml model folder I included the code relevant to building the model used for this project (randomforestmodel.ipynb) Along with the code specifically relevant for building the shiny web app interface (under the folder app/boxing).
